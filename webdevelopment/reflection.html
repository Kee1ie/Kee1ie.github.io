        <h4>I am a passionate performer.</h4>
        <p>Throughout my experiences as a piano major in university, I have grown to love communities
        that appreciate classical music. I found more purpose in spreading the power of music to
        transcend language, connect people, and inspire others. Listening to any piece is a better
        experience when shared with an audience. I wish to keep the masterpieces of classical piano
        alive, even in our quickly evolving society today.</p>
        <h4>I am an ardent collaborator.</h4>
        <p>In a similar manner, collaborating with other musicians is a unique and special experience. I have
        been able to explore this from my experience at Bowdoin Music Festival and with my piano trio.
        Playing with other instruments opens so many opportunities for me as a pianist to share hidden
        gems in the repertoire.</p>
        <h4>I am a growing educator.</h4>
        <p>I started teaching during my junior year at university, and I love teaching students and guiding
        them through their own musical journey. My teaching philosophy is to emphasize a positive
        relationship between you and music. As a performer, it can be easy to fall into frustration and
        anger during practice. However, this can become incredibly unhealthy and
        self-harming—instead, I want to inspire through my teaching.</p>
        <h4>I am always learning.</h4>
        <p>Even in high school, I always loved expanding my horizons in any subject. I took many courses
        in preparation for a career in the STEM field, specifically chemistry. In fact, I started university
        at Mizzou with a double major in chemistry and music. I started undergraduate research, but
        quickly realized that I felt devoid of life and purpose in the lab. My transition to music gave me
        more purpose, but I have kept my curiosity and desire for knowledge.</p>
