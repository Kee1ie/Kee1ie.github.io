                <p>
                    I am a senior at the University of Missouri - Columbia and will graduate in Spring 2024.
                    My major is <b>Piano Performance</b>, and I work extensively in the School of Music.
                    I plan to receive a business minor, an IT certificate, and a multicultural studies certificate.<br><br>
                    After graduating, I intend to continue my education in graduate school. Along with performing, I
                    love teaching students through the university’s Community Music Program. I have had success
                    in various solo and chamber music competitions. Most recently, my trio was a finalist in the
                    2024 <em>National Music Teachers National Association (MTNA)</em> Chamber Music Competition. As I
                    build up my professional career, I hope to inspire others in my community through music.</p>
