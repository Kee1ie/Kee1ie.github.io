        <h4>My name is Ryan Kee, and I am an aspiring concert pianist.</h4>
        <p>
            I am a senior at the University of Missouri - Columbia and will graduate in Spring 2024.
            My major is <b>Piano Performance</b>, and I work extensively in the School of Music.
            I plan to receive a business minor, an IT certificate, <em>and</em> a multicultural studies certificate.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating, I intend to continue my education in graduate school. Along with performing, I
            love teaching students through the university’s Community Music Program. I have had success
            in various solo and chamber music competitions. Most recently, my trio will be a finalist in the
            2024 <em>National Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) Chamber Music Competition</em>. As I
            build up my professional career, I hope to inspire others in my community through music.
