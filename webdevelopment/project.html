                    At the School of Music, I rehearse and perform regularly with violinist Alexandre Negrao and
                    cellist Dean Wibe as the Kaizen Piano Trio. We performed in the Kauffman Center in Kansas
                    City for a masterclass with Michael Stern and were finalists in the 2024 National Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) Chamber Music Competition.
                    The Kaizen Trio put on a recital on April 12th, 2024 at Sheryl Crow Hall. In this concert, we
                    performed Grieg's Andante con moto, Gabriela Lena Frank's Four Folk Songs for Piano Trio, and
                    Ravel’s Piano Trio.

                    This recital was performed on December 2nd, 2023, as a part of my degree program, which
                    requires me to perform at least two full-length recitals. The concert was held in Sheryl Crow
                    Hall and livestreamed by the School of Music. The program consisted of Bach’s Toccata in D
                    Minor, Beethoven’s Sonata No. 28 in A Major, Chopin’s Scherzo No. 4 in E Major, Chopin’s
                    Etude No.7 in C Major, Liszt’s Paganini Etude No. 2, and Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite (arranged
                    by Guido Agosti). These pieces make up my audition program for my gradation auditions as
                    well. For my Capstone, I wrote program notes for all these pieces. These notes can be accessed here:

                    During the summer of 2023, I attended the Bowdoin International Music Festival held in
                    Brunswick, Maine. The festival is prestigious, with music students from all over the world
                    attending. I love getting to meet different musicians from all kinds of backgrounds. For three
                    weeks, I studied solo repertoire with pianist Matti Raekallio and chamber music with pianist Liza
                    Stepanova. In this short time, I rehearsed and performed two movements of Smetana’s Piano Trio
                    in G Minor in the Studzinski Recital Hall. I was also able to attend many faculty concerts, where
                    there was an emphasis on underrepresented pieces.
