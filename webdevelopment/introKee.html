    My name is Ryan Kee, and I am an aspiring concert pianist.
    I am a senior at the University of Missouri - Columbia and will graduate in Spring 2024.
    My major is piano performance, and I work extensively in the School of Music.
    I plan to receive a business minor, an IT certificate, and a multicultural studies certificate.
    I have had success in various solo and chamber music competitions. Also, I will be auditioning for graduate school this semester.
    I am taking Web Design and Development as a part of my IT certificate. I have taken coding classes for Java, C#, Python, and database systems including MySQL and MongoDB.
    I have no experience in web applications, so Iâ€™m excited to learn the basics. As a pianist, I will have to create a professional website for myself in the future. I hope this class will set up a good foundation for my studies in web development.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, sleeping, and watching shows.
